It is a short way but not permanent

first create a container

docker run  ..... -p 22022:2222 .....

port 22022 on your host machine will map on 2222, we change the ssh port on container later , then on your container executing the following commands

apt update && apt install  openssh-server # install ssh server
passwd #change root password

in file /etc/ssh/sshd_config change these : uncomment Port and change it to 2222

Port 2222

uncomment PermitRootLogin to PermitRootLogin yes

and finally restart ssh server

/etc/init.d/ssh start

you can login to your container now

ssh -p 2022 root@HostIP

Remember : if you restart the container you need to restart ssh server again
